# ðŸ’¼ COGS Anomaly Detection using ðŸ¤– Machine Learning and ðŸ§  Gen AI

![Problem](https://github.com/WilfredoLandaverde/COGS-Anomaly-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Gen-AI-/blob/2a4853fd22fbebe8f4f1fe2a9d2db1cb8836540c/images/Problem_Statement.png)


This project uses a public dataset of U.S. retail sales from 2010 and 2011 to apply Machine Learning for detecting and analyzing anomalies in Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and leverages Generative AI to interpret the results in a business-relevant, non-technical manner.


# ðŸš€ Solution Overview


![Solution](https://github.com/WilfredoLandaverde/COGS-Anomaly-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Gen-AI-/blob/788c1129c7682581646ab7a8a0957e4647f46dfb/images/Solution_Overview.png)


# ðŸ’¡ Business Value

- Simplifying technical language for a business audience using Gen AI
- Improve decision speed and accuracy with Machine Learning & Gen AI.
- Improve profitability by detecting COGS anomalies on a timely manner
- Designed for scalability, it can process large datasets (Automated analysis)


# ðŸ”¥ Output Demonstration

After developing the model using Isolation Forest 'Algorithm to detect the anomalies and only taking the top 5, SHAP values is used to understand why a Machine Learning model made a certain prediction. Then, this information is included in a prompt using Gemini API to generate a business-like summary for the specify anomaly.
This is an example:
